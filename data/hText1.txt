1. Choose a country that you are interested in.
Included in the Country-list are also World and European Union.
World is data for the whole world combined, while European Union is data of all countries in the EU combined.

2. Choose an indicator that you are interested in.
The indicators are listed in the tab Data, together with links leading to the raw data.

3. Choose a period that you are interested in.

Note:
If there is no data, or if all data available is zero, there will be no calculation and no plot.
The best thing to do is just to go ahead and make other choices for country, indicator and/or period.
