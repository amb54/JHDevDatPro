The indicators used in this app are listed below and are just a few of many more that can be found on the World Bank's webpage.
They are sorted under General data, Infrastructure and Health.

The very important topic Education is NOT included in this app due to it being quite complicated and calling for an app of its own.
Learn more about education by following the link
http://data.worldbank.org/topic/education.  

Before the data was used in this app it was gathered into one data file.
The code for how this was done can be found at github
